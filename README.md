In implementing the ant colony optimization algorithm, the developer has used 500 ants and 8 US-based cities to calculate the shortest route for the TSP. The developer found out that the number of ants does not affect finding the shortest route. They also observed that the number of cities does not increase the time to calculate the shortest route. In ACO, the shortest route's distance is 6047 miles, but every time the program has generated the ant, which finds the best path is always different. The course is still different, and even the distance remains the same.
