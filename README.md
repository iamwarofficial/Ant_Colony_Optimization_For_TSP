# Ant Colony Optimization For TSP
 
 The developer has implemented the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm into the Java Platform. Ant Colony Optimization is the most efficient algorithm for TSP. To make the trials fair, the author used the same number of US-based cities. The distance between each city is identified by its latitude and longitudes coordinates. The Haversine formula is used to calculate distances between cities. The Haversine formula calculates the shortest distance between two points on a sphere using their latitudes and longitudes measured along the surface. It is essential for use in navigation.
 
 In ant colony optimization algorithm implementation, the developer has used 500 ants and 8 US-based cities to calculate the shortest route for the TSP. The developer found out that the number of ants does not affect the performance of finding the shortest route. They also observed that the number of cities does not increase the time to calculate the shortest route. In ACO, the distance of the shortest route is 6047 miles, but every time the program has generated the ant, which finds the best path is always different. Also, the course is still different, and even the distance remains the same.
